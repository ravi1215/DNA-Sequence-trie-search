# DNA-Sequence-trie-search
A C++ application implementing a Trie data structure for efficient DNA sequence matching. This project supports exact and approximate searches with customizable mismatch tolerance. It reads DNA sequences from a FASTA file, builds a Trie, and provides a command-line interface for searching sequences with optional mismatch handling.
